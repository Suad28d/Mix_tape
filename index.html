    Rich nigga bread, stay poppin' up like a toaster<br />
    Nobody come close<br />
    To me and you together<br />
    Step under my umbrella,<br />
    We'll make it through any weather<br />
    Except when I make it storm,<br />
    Sex in the greatest form<br />
    And hibernate under my body<br />
    And yep I keep it warmer than a chinchilla<br />
    She know I beat it up like the thriller in Manila<br />
    Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla<br />
    Then throw you on a grill<br />
    That's 'cause seven days a week you're my 5 course meal<br />
    For real!<br />
    Baby, tonight's the night I let you know<br />
    Baby, tonight's the night we lose control<br />
    Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that<br />
    Tonight I'll be the best you ever had<br />
    I don't wanna brag,<br />
    But I'll be the best you ever had<br />
